                    <p>I make content for platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok. I've been uploading videos on YouTube for nearly 3 years,
                    sporadically, there hasn't been much consisten uploading. However, as I move forwards into 2025 with new dreams and aspirations,
                    I expect to be more harsh on myself when it comes to upload consistency and accountability. "One must consider the time he's been
                    alloted and what he does with said time" something I've thought a lot about recently, something I aim to implement into my personal
                    life to test my meddle and mental fortitude.

                    <p>This is a video I upoaded on YouTube roughly 2 years ago. I leave it on here as a testement to the changes I've gone through,
                        whether it be the time I've spent online or offline. My ideals have shifted since then, with my desires and aspirations shifting
                        as well. In 3 years time it'll have been 5 years since I uploaded this video, I see the difference between every 5 years as being 
                        an oppourunity to change as a person and grow substantially, allowing you to look back and see the progress you've achieved and 
                        check yourself to see if you're becoming the person you want to be.

                    <p>The tranistion to TikTok is to keep with the trends and with what people enjoy, also my friends are all really into
                    it. This is a TikTok I made from an edate I was watching that my friend was moderating, it was pretty cringe stuff.

                    <p> I expect, with the aid of friends and personal dedication, that this channel will grow within the next year.
                        Maybe with a shift in content, as I expect of myself, will my channel find new avenues for revenue and growth.

                    <p>This is a work in progress, as I better my skills in web design and programming I expect this to be a fun little
                        side project, thus far it's been pretty amusing.
